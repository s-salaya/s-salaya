# Sergio Salaya (s-salaya)
University student in Cancún (MX) building practical IT + security skills daily.
I study 4–6 focused hours/day and ship evidence daily.
Target roles (6–9 months): **Help Desk / NOC / SOC (Tier 1)**  
Long-term: **Secure Infrastructure Architect** + **Purple Team Engineer**

## What I do
I build and document labs that prove I can:
- Troubleshoot networks (L2/L3 basics, DNS/DHCP, routing, VLAN concepts)
- Administer Linux (Debian-focused) and virtualized environments (KVM)
- Capture + analyze traffic (tcpdump/Wireshark) and write clear incident-style notes
- Automate repeatable tasks with shell scripting and tight documentation

## Current focus
- **CompTIA Network+ (N10-009)**: daily study + labs
- **Home lab**: Debian host and KVM: isolated networks, packet captures, service troubleshooting
- **Portfolio**: each lab produces a README + evidence files (pcaps, configs, screenshots)

## Active projects
- **Networking-Fundamentals** — packet captures + Network+ mapped notes  
  Evidence: `packet-captures/*.pcap`, `notes/*.md`  
  Repo: `https://github.com/s-salaya/networking-fundamentals`

- **Debian-KVM-Network-Lab** — KVM build, networking, snapshots, baseline hardening  
  Evidence: `docs/`, `configs/`, command transcripts  
  Repo: `https://github.com/s-salaya/debian-kvm-lab`

- **SOC-Fundamentals** — detection notes, triage checklists, ATT&CK mapping (sanitized)  
  Evidence: `writeups/`, `checklists/`  
  Repo: `https://github.com/s-salaya/soc-notes`

## How I work
- Minimum **1 Git commit per study day** (Conventional Commits only)
- Minimum **15 minutes of Anki/day**
- Notes in Obsidian → exported to Markdown → pushed to GitHub
- I do not publish secrets, private IPs are fine, public IPs/tokens are not

## Verification (how you can check my work)
- Look for **pcap files** and **reproducible commands** in each repo
- Each repo README includes:
  - Purpose
  - How-to (exact commands)
  - Learning outcomes
  - Verification steps
  - Evidence filenames
